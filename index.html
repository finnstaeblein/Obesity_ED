              <p class="card-text">
                Obesity has increased almost everywhere over the past few decades.
                Estimates from the World Health Organization indicate that global adult obesity
                has nearly tripled since 1975, reaching about <strong>1 in 8 adults</strong> worldwide by 2022 <a
                  href="#source-4" class="footnote-link">[4]</a>.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                The map shows the <strong>latest available adult obesity rates by country</strong>.
                Darker regions indicate a larger share of adults living with obesity, while lighter regions
                indicate lower levels. The data come from standardized NCD surveys, which makes it
                possible to compare countries directly <a href="#source-5" class="footnote-link">[5]</a>.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                A few patterns to notice: high rates appear in places like the
                <strong>United States</strong>, the <strong>Gulf states</strong>, and several
                <strong>Pacific Island nations</strong>, while much of <strong>East and Southeast Asia</strong>
                remains on the lower end. Many countries in <strong>Africa and South Asia</strong> are still
                relatively low but <strong>rising quickly</strong> <a href="#source-5" class="footnote-link">[5]</a>.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                Rather than a single global trend, the map suggests very different national trajectories.
                That raises a question we'll return to: are these differences driven more by activity, diet,
                economics, or something else? In the next section, you'll be able to
                <strong>click individual countries</strong> to see how their obesity rates have changed over time.

                The map lets you <strong>click any country</strong> to explore how its obesity
                rates have changed across adults, women, men, and—when available—children.
                This time-series view uses standardized NCD-RisC estimates that track
                obesity prevalence from the <strong>late 1970s to today</strong> <a href="#source-5"

              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                What you'll notice is that almost every country shows an upward trend, but
                <strong>the timing, slope and Y axis scale are very different</strong>. Some countries
                began rising early, others much later, and some increased more sharply than others.
                These differences are the starting point for understanding what might be driving
                obesity patterns around the world.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                Try clicking countries with contrasting stories—like the United States, Japan,
                or the Gulf states. Their trajectories raise important questions about
                <strong>why some places surged quickly while others remained low for decades</strong>.

              <h3 class="card-title">A steep early rise: United States</h3>

              <p class="card-text">
                When you look at the United States on the chart, the obesity curve starts
                climbing early and never really flattens. National survey data show that
                adult obesity has roughly <strong>tripled over the last several decades</strong>, and
                recent CDC estimates put adult obesity at around <strong>40%</strong> of the population <a
                  href="#source-6" class="footnote-link">[6]</a> <a href="#source-7" class="footnote-link">[7]</a>.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                In this view, both adults and children in the U.S. show an
                <strong>early, linear rise</strong> compared with many other countries. The levels are not
                only high today; they have been high for a long time. That makes the U.S.
                an example of a country where obesity became common relatively early in the
                global timeline.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                Keep this shape in mind as a reference point when you click through to the

              <h3 class="card-title">A slow, low curve: Japan</h3>

              <p class="card-text">
                Japan's trend looks very different. Even as a high-income country with long-standing
                urbanization, its adult obesity levels remain much lower than in most OECD peers.
                Recent analyses find that Japan has one of the <strong>lowest rates of overweight and
                  obesity among OECD countries</strong>, and average BMI has changed only gradually over
                several decades <a href="#source-8" class="footnote-link">[8]</a> <a href="#source-9"
                  class="footnote-link">[9]</a>.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                On the chart, that shows up as a <strong>flatter, lower line</strong> for adults and children:
                obesity rises, but much more slowly and from a very low starting point. Compared
                with the U.S., Japan offers a contrast where economic development did not produce
                the same jump in obesity levels.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                This contrast raises a key question for later: if income or development alone
                doesn't explain the gap between the U.S. and Japan, what else might be different
                in their food environments or daily lives?

              <p class="card-text">
                In many Gulf countries, such as <strong>Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, and Bahrain</strong>,
                the pattern is a later but very rapid rise. Recent estimates place adult obesity
                levels in the <strong>high 30s to low 40s percent</strong> range, putting several of these
                countries among the highest in the world <a href="#source-10" class="footnote-link">[10]</a> <a
                  href="#source-11" class="footnote-link">[11]</a>.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                On the chart, that shows up as a <strong>sharp upswing starting later in time</strong>:
                obesity was relatively uncommon several decades ago, then increased quickly alongside
                rapid changes in income, urbanization, and food environments. In some Gulf states,
                women's obesity rates in particular reach some of the highest levels globally.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                Taken together, these three curves—U.S., Japan, and the Gulf—illustrate that obesity
                can become common early, stay low for a long time, or surge rapidly once conditions
                change. In the next section, you'll be able to explore these patterns more broadly
                and start asking what might be driving them: <strong>activity, diet, policy, or
                  something else entirely?</strong>

                whether children's trends lag behind adults, and whether patterns differ by sex.
                In many countries, you'll see that childhood obesity is now climbing into ranges

                At its core, obesity occurs when energy intake is consistently higher than energy expenditure. The
                harder question is which side of this balance has changed in modern populations. Public health
                organizations typically point to two possibilities: people may be burning less energy through daily
                activity, or they may be consuming more energy as diets shift <a href="#source-1"
                  class="footnote-link">[1]</a>. To see how this aligns with public perception, consider what Americans
                say is the main reason many people are very overweight.</p>

                A 2006 Pew survey captured Americans’ beliefs about what was causing obesity. Most respondents pointed
                to personal behavior as the main driver, and they overwhelmingly pointed to one explanation in
                particular: not getting enough exercise. In fact, they rated lack of activity as the most important
                reason people are overweight, ahead of diet, marketing, or genetics <a href="#source-2"

                was at least at that time a common hypothesis shared with health organizations, that industrialized

        <h2 class="conclusion-heading">Examining the Activity Hypothesis</h2>
        <p class="conclusion-text">
          Given how common this assumption is, the next step is to look at it with data. Given how common this
          assumption is, the next step is to look at it with actual measurements rather than beliefs. A recent cross
          cultural study published in PNAS did this by using the doubly labeled water method, the leading approach for
          measuring total daily energy expenditure in real-world settings. The researchers drew from the International
          Atomic Energy Agency’s global database of doubly labeled water measurements and expanded it by adding three
          additional pastoralist groups: the Aymara in Bolivia, the Tuvan in Siberia, and the Daasanach in northern
          Kenya.
          <p />
        <p class="conclusion-text">The initial dataset contained more than 10,000 adults. The team then filtered out
          anyone with missing sex, reported health conditions, athletic status, implausibly high energy expenditure, or
          ages outside 18 to 60. This produced a final analytic sample of 4,213 adults across 34 population groups.
          These
          groups are specific community samples, not nationally representative estimates. The goal was to compare energy
          expenditure across different subsistence ecologies and economic contexts, not to characterize whole countries.
          <p />
        <p class="conclusion-text">The populations span hunter gatherers, pastoralists, horticulturalists, small
          scale farmers, and industrialized groups. Because nonindustrialized groups do not have formal Human
          Development
          Index scores, the researchers placed them on the HDI spectrum based on their level of market integration.
          Industrialized populations were categorized using standard UN HDI thresholds for low, medium, and high
          development. HDI values were then converted into rank order, so the analysis uses each population’s relative
          position along the development spectrum.
        </p>
        <p class="conclusion-text">Basal energy expenditure came from indirect calorimetry when available or from
          size-based predictive equations when not. Activity energy expenditure and physical activity level were derived
          from the total and basal expenditure values.
        </p>
        <p class="conclusion-text">Because access to the individual level dataset requires a formal research
          application, this analysis uses only the publicly available population means. Working with means makes it
          possible to compare broad patterns across populations, but it introduces important limitations. The underlying
          distributions for each group are not available, so measures such as standard deviations, confidence intervals,
          or within-group variability cannot be calculated. As a result, the analysis can identify population-level
          trends
          across economic and lifestyle contexts, but it cannot capture how much variation exists within each group or
          how
          precise the reported averages are.
        </p>
        <p class="conclusion-text">The visualizations below examine how activity levels vary across economic
          contexts and whether those differences track with body fat percentage or whether another factor explains body
          fat more strongly.

                The map shows where the 34 sampled communities are located. A few patterns are worth keeping in mind as
                you interpret the results. High-HDI groups are heavily represented, especially in Europe, the US, and
                East Asia. These samples are larger and give more stable averages. In contrast, the subsistence groups
                (hunter gatherers, horticulturalists, and agropastoralist) appear in only a handful of regions and often
                with smaller sample sizes. They are key for comparing different lifestyles, but each point represents
                one community, not an entire country.

                This uneven distribution means the analysis can compare broad differences across economic and lifestyle
                contexts, but high-HDI groups carry more statistical weight and subsistence groups provide only a few
                anchor points.

              <p class="card-text">
                The plot shows that higher-HDI populations generally sit at the lower-rank end and tend to have higher
                body fat percentages, while subsistence groups cluster at the higher-rank end with lower body fat. There
                is still substantial variation within each category, especially among high-HDI populations, but the

                What this might suggest is that some factor linked to economic development is associated with higher

                multiple explanations, but it sets up the next step: looking at whether activity levels follow a similar
                pattern or whether the stronger pattern appears elsewhere in the data.

              <p class="card-text">
                This plot compares body fat percentage with Physical Activity Level (PAL), which is total energy
                expenditure divided by basal energy expenditure. PAL gives a size-adjusted measure of daily activity.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Across populations, the relationship here is weak. Some groups with higher PAL have lower body fat, but
                others do not, and the points are widely scattered for both men and women. High-HDI populations show
                especially broad variation: some are fairly active with moderate body fat, while others have similar PAL
                values but higher body fat.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                What we can take from this is limited but useful. If physical activity were a dominant driver of
                population-level differences in body fat, we would expect a clearer downward trend. Instead, the
                variability suggests that activity alone does not explain why some populations have much higher body fat
                than others. This doesn’t rule out an effect of activity, it just means the pattern is not strong or
                consistent at this scale.

              <p class="card-text">
                This plot compares body fat percentage with the share of ultra processed foods (UPF) in the diet. Unlike
                the activity plots, the points line up more clearly here. Populations with higher UPF intake tend to
                have higher body fat, and this pattern shows up for both men and women. There is still variation, some
                groups eat relatively little UPF and differ in body fat, and some high UPF groups sit below the trend
                line, but the overall slope is stronger than what we saw for PAL or TEE.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                It’s also worth noting that UPF data were available for only 25 of the 34 populations, so the coverage
                is not complete. Even with that limitation, the relationship appears more consistent than the activity
                based measures. This doesn’t prove that UPF is the cause, but it suggests that dietary composition may
                align more closely with differences in body fat across populations than physical activity does.

        <h2 class="conclusion-heading">Takeaways</h2>
        <p class="conclusion-text">
          Taken together, the population-level data present a clearer picture of how obesity varies across different
          economic and lifestyle contexts. Once body size is accounted for, physical activity levels show only modest
          variation between populations. That makes it unlikely that changes in daily movement alone explain the large
          differences in obesity rates across societies. By contrast, in the subset of populations for which dietary
          data exist, there is a more consistent link: higher intake of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) appears associated
          with higher body-fat percentage. This does not prove causation, but it suggests dietary composition may matter
          more than activity in shaping obesity differences at population scale.
        </p>

        <h2 class="conclusion-heading">Why this matters</h2>
        <p class="conclusion-text">
          Public understanding of obesity tends to emphasize activity (move more, sit less) and personal responsibility.
          Survey data show many Americans attribute weight problems to lack of exercise or willpower. But this framing
          may reflect not only intuition, it may also reflect the influence of industry: some historical analyses
          suggest that certain food and beverage companies funded studies and public campaigns that highlighted physical
          inactivity as the root cause of obesity <a href="#source-3" class="footnote-link">[3]</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          If dietary factors, especially the prevalence of UPFs, have a stronger link to obesity across populations than
          activity, then strategies focused mainly on individual behavior or exercise may miss a larger lever. Instead
          of placing the burden solely on individuals to "move more," public health efforts might be more effective if
          they address structural and environmental drivers: availability, marketing, formulation, and consumption of
          UPFs.</p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          That's not to say individuals don't matter. Diet and activity both influence health. But orienting policy and
          resources around the stronger population-level signal could lead to larger-scale impact.</p>

        <h2 class="conclusion-heading">Limitations</h2>
        <p class="conclusion-text">
          Several limitations of the dataset and analysis should be noted.
        </p>
        <ul class="conclusion-text">
          <li>The dietary data cover only a portion of the sample (25 of the 34 populations).</li>
          <li>The analysis relies on population means, not individual-level data, so within-population variation and
            uncertainty (such as confidence intervals or standard deviations) cannot be assessed.</li>
          <li>The data are cross-sectional, reflecting differences between populations at one point in time. This
            prevents us from inferring how changes over time influence body fat.</li>
          <li>The associations observed are correlational, and unmeasured factors (such as genetics or other lifestyle
            variables) may contribute to the patterns.</li>
          <li>Energy-expenditure measurements come from different studies and methods, which may introduce measurement
            heterogeneity.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          While these limitations exist, the patterns still point toward a need for better dietary data, long-term
          studies, and policy approaches that address food environments directly. Earlier industry messaging often
          emphasized activity, but moving forward it will be important for governments and communities to take a
          stronger role in challenging that narrative. Framing obesity as a structural issue rather than an individual
          failure can open the door to more funding, better regulation, and broader efforts to reduce UPF exposure and
          support healthier diets.

              <h3 class="card-title">Obesity Showing Signs of Decline in U.S.</h3>

              <p class="card-text">
                For the first time in modern history, U.S. obesity rates are declining. According to Gallup's 2025 National Health
                and Well-Being Index, adult obesity has fallen from a record 39.9% in 2022 to 37.0% in 2025 - representing an estimated
                7.6 million fewer adults with obesity <a href="#glp1-source-14" class="footnote-link">[14]</a>. At the same time, 
                diabetes rates continue to rise, which a is expected given that Type II diabetes typically develops only after many 
                years of underlying insulin resistance, a condition strongly influenced by long-term obesity.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                This decline parallels the rapid adoption of GLP-1 receptor agonists (such as semaglutide in Ozempic and Wegovy, and
                tirzepatide in Mounjaro and Zepbound). From 2018 to 2023, spending on GLP-1 medications rose by more than 500%, from
                $13.7 billion to $71.7 billion <a href="#glp1-source-12" class="footnote-link">[12]</a>. Survey data from KFF indicates
                that around 40% of prescriptions are primarily for weight management <a href="#glp1-source-15" class="footnote-link">[15]</a>,
                and usage has surged from 5.8% of adults in early 2024 to 12.4% in 2025 <a href="#glp1-source-14" class="footnote-link">[14]</a>.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                The steepest reductions in obesity are occurring in the very age groups with the highest GLP-1 usage (ages 40–64),
                suggesting these medications may be contributing to the first sustained population-level decline in U.S. obesity rates.
                But understanding why GLP-1s are so effective requires looking at the biological pathway they target - the
                same energy-regulation circuitry disrupted by ultra-processed foods and, in rare cases, by genetic mutations.

              <h3 class="card-title">UPFs disrupt the same pathway—and GLP-1s restore it</h3>

              <p class="card-text">
                As we saw in the earlier analysis, the populations with the highest ultra-processed food (UPF) consumption
                also tend to have the highest body fat percentages. This is no coincidence: <strong>UPFs disrupt the
                leptin–melanocortin pathway, a neuronal circuit in the hypothalamus that regulates hunger, satiety, and metabolism</strong>.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                UPFs are energy-dense, rapidly absorbable, and engineered to be hyper-palatable. When consumed regularly,
                they drive repeated spikes in glucose, insulin, inflammatory signals, and leptin. Over time, this barrage
                leads the hypothalamus to become progressively less responsive to leptin and insulin—a state called
                leptin and insulin resistance. In this state, the brain perceives the body as having less
                stored energy than it actually does, triggering the same biological response seen in genetic obesity: hunger increases,
                satiety decreases, and metabolic rate slows.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                Here's why the obesity decline shown earlier matters: GLP-1 medications act on this same energy-regulation circuitry. 
                They stimulate satiety-promoting neurons and dampen hunger-promoting neurons, essentially
                overriding the dysfunctional signals that arise from leptin resistance. By counteracting the dysfunction of this pathway
                caused by UPFs, GLP1s help change eating behavior. Specifically, they restore satiety signals and in doing so reduce
                the appeal and consumption of hyper-palatable ultra-processed foods.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                This dual mechanism — restoring satiety and reducing UPF consumption - is likely why we're seeing the first sustained
                population-level obesity decline in U.S. history. It's not just about individual willpower or exercise; it's
                about addressing a biological dysfunction that inevitably leads to overconsumption.

        <h3 class="conclusion-heading">Implications: Where GLP-1s Are Needed Most</h3>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          Understanding that GLP-1 medications work by targeting the same biological pathway disrupted by ultra-processed
          foods has important policy implications. Since UPF consumption drives obesity through pathway dysfunction, and GLP-1s
          restore that pathway, then ensuring access to these medications in regions with the highest obesity rates
          becomes a public health priority.
        </p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          The interactive state-by-state visualization below shows an encouraging pattern: states with higher obesity rates
          tend to have higher GLP-1 prescription counts. This suggests that GLP-1 medications are reaching the locations
          where they are needed most. However, it's important to note that this data reflects only prescription
          patterns and does not account for off-label usage or non-prescription access, which may be substantial
          in some regions.
        </p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          Despite this limitation, the alignment between obesity rates and prescription patterns is a positive sign. It indicates
          that clinical need is driving adoption. However, access remains unequal. Monthly out-of-pocket costs often range from
          $1,000–$1,300 without insurance, making these medications unaffordable for many people in the regions with 
          highest obesity rates (Midwest and Southern) as respective states are mostly also the ones with much lower average incomes 
          (feel free to check this out by clicking the 'Size by Income' button in the visualization). As a result, the true distribution 
          of GLP-1 usage is almost certainly more uneven than the prescription patterns alone suggest.
        </p>

        <!-- <p class="conclusion-text">
          The leptin–melanocortin pathway we explored above also enables us to understand why GLP-1s are so effective.
          Although GLP-1 receptor agonists (such as semaglutide, the active drug molecule found in Ozempic and Wegovy;
          as well as
          tirzepatide, found in Rybelsus and Zepbound) do not directly repair the leptin–melanocortin pathway, they
          effectively bypass its
          dysfunction by activating downstream circuits that compensate for its impaired signaling.
        </p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          GLP-1 receptors are expressed on several of the same hypothalamic neurons involved in the leptin–melanocortin
          system, including POMC neurons—the very neurons that normally promote satiety when leptin binds to them.
          In individuals with genetic susceptibility or leptin resistance, these neurons receive a weakened signal from
          leptin.
          GLP-1 agonists step in by stimulating these satiety-promoting neurons through
          a different hormonal channel, restoring the fullness signal that the brain would otherwise be missing.
        </p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          In addition, GLP-1 agonists reduce activity in AgRP/NPY "hunger neurons," the counterparts that normally
          elevate appetite when the brain thinks energy stores are low. By dampening these neurons and simultaneously
          enhancing POMC activity, GLP-1 drugs re-establish a functional imbalance in favor of satiety — essentially
          overriding the biased signals coming from a disrupted leptin–melanocortin system.
        </p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          This dual action explains why GLP-1 medications so effectively reduce appetite, increase fullness, and
          shift energy expenditure in a direction that supports weight loss, even in individuals whose central
          regulatory circuits are environmentally (or in rare cases genetically) impaired.

          This underscores a crucial role for government intervention: expanding access to GLP-1 medications in
          high-obesity regions should be a policy priority. If we understand obesity as a biological dysfunction
          caused by environmental factors (namely, UPF-dominated food environments), then treating it requires 
          systemic solutions that include making effective medications accessible
          to those who need them most, regardless of income or geography.
        </p>
        <!-- <p class="conclusion-text">
          The visualization also reflects the broader national surge in GLP-1 use. From 2018 to 2023, spending for GLP-1
          agonists
          rose by more than 500%, from $13.7 billion to $71.7 billion. <a href="#glp1-source-12"
            class="footnote-link">[12]</a> While there is insufficient data to determine what percentage was prescribed
          primarily for diabetes vs weight management,
          survey data from KFF indicates that around 40% are primarily for weight management. <a href="#glp1-source-15"
            class="footnote-link">[15]</a>
        </p>
        <p class="conclusion-text">
          In the state-by-state visualization above, we observe that states with higher prescription counts tend to be
          those with higher obesity rates.
          This alignment makes sense: GLP-1 medications are most heavily prescribed where clinical need is greatest.
          However, it is important to interpret these data cautiously. Prescription data exclude the very large share of
          off-label use and commercial cash-pay volume, particularly in states where out-of-pocket monthly costs
          (often $1,000–$1,300 without insurance) aren't affordable for most people (unfortunately, Midwestern and
          Southern states have higher obesity rates and a much lower average income).
          As a result, the true distribution of GLP-1 usage is almost certainly more uneven than the prescription
          patterns alone suggest.
        </p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          Nevertheless, the historic spike in GLP-1 uptake is almost certainly contributing to a trend that has never
          before been observed in the United States:
          a <strong>measurable decline in national obesity rates</strong>. According to Gallup's 2025 National Health
          and Well-Being Index, U.S. adult obesity
          has fallen from a record 39.9% in 2022 to 37.0% in 2025—an estimated 7.6 million fewer adults with obesity.
          This drop parallels the rapid adoption
          of GLP-1 injectables, which rose from 5.8% of adults using them for weight loss in early 2024 to 12.4% in
          2025, with the steepest reductions in
          obesity occurring in the very age groups with the highest GLP-1 usage (ages 40–64). <a href="#glp1-source-14"
            class="footnote-link">[14]</a>
        </p> -->

        <h3 class="conclusion-heading" style="margin-top: 40px;">A Cautionary Note: GLP-1s Are Not a Silver Bullet</h3>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          While this encouraging decline in obesity rates is historic, it does not address the underlying drivers of the epidemic.
          GLP-1s can counteract a dysfunctional leptin–melanocortin pathway and restore satiety signals, but relying solely on 
          medication to manage weight ignores a crucial reality: obesity is only one manifestation of poor dietary quality.
        </p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          The goal should not simply be to eat less—it should be to eat better. Ultra-processed foods don't just
          drive weight gain; they are independently associated with cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, metabolic dysfunction,
          chronic inflammation, and many cancers. A person on GLP-1 medication who continues consuming a diet dominated by
          UPFs may lose weight, but they remain exposed to the broader health consequences that obesity metrics
          alone don't capture.
        </p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          This underscores the importance of policy action when it comes to our food system. While expanding access to GLP-1 medications is a vital public health
          intervention, it must be paired with efforts to address the root cause: the pervasive availability and aggressive
          marketing of ultra-processed foods that makes unhealthy eating the default choice. Policy solutions should include improving food environments—especially in
          underserved communities—supporting nutrition education, regulating misleading health claims on processed foods, and incentivizing
          the production and accessibility of whole, minimally processed foods.
