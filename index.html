              <p class="card-text">
                Obesity has increased almost everywhere over the past few decades.
                Estimates from the World Health Organization indicate that global adult obesity
                has nearly tripled since 1975, reaching about 1 in 8 adults
                worldwide by 2022 <a href="#source-4" class="footnote-link">[4]</a>.

                The interactive visualization on the left uses standardized data from the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration
                tracking obesity prevalence from 1990 to 2022 <a href="#source-5" class="footnote-link">[5]</a>.
                Try pressing the "play" button to watch how obesity has become more common over time.

              <p class="card-text">
                While the timing and speed of rising obesity differ across countries, obesity is
                becoming more common. That raises two questions: why is it increasing at all, and what explains the
                differences between countries?

                At its core, obesity occurs when energy intake is consistently higher than energy expenditure.
                The harder question is which side of that balance has shifted in the last few decades. Public health
                organizations typically point to two possibilities: people may be burning less energy through daily
                activity, or they may be consuming more energy as diets shift <a href="#source-1"

                A 2006 Pew survey captured Americans’ beliefs about what was causing obesity. Most respondents pointed
                to personal behavior as the main driver, and they overwhelmingly pointed to one explanation in
                particular: not getting enough exercise. In fact, they rated lack of activity as the most important

        <h2 class="conclusion-heading">Examining the Activity Hypothesis</h2>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          A cross-cultural study in PNAS directly tested the assumption that rising obesity is driven by declines in
          physical activity. The researchers measured total daily energy expenditure using the doubly labeled water
          method, drawing from the International Atomic Energy Agency’s global database and adding three additional
          populations: the Aymara in Bolivia, the Tuvan in Siberia, and the Daasanach in northern Kenya <a
            href="#source-1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="conclusion-text">
          The final study sample included 4,213 adults across 34 population groups. The original team had access to
          individual level measurements, but access to that data requires a formal application. This analysis uses only
          the
          published population means from their study. Also, each population represents a community sample, not a
          national estimate.
        </p>
        <p class="conclusion-text">
          We included hunter gatherers, pastoralists, horticulturalists, small scale farmers, and industrialized groups
          because they differ in lifestyle, and market integration. These differences allow
          better comparisons across variables that may predict obesity levels. To measure obesity we did not use body
          mass index but body fat percentage to avoid penalizing individuals with higher muscle mass.
        </p>
        <!-- Nonindustrialized groups were placed on the Human Development Index spectrum using their level of market
          integration. Industrialized groups used standard UN HDI thresholds. All HDI values were converted into ranks
          to place the 34 groups on a single development continuum. -->

        <!-- <p class="conclusion-text">
          Given how common this assumption is, the next step is to look at it with data. Given how common this
          assumption is, the next step is to look at it with actual measurements rather than beliefs. A recent cross
          cultural study published in PNAS did this by using the doubly labeled water method, the leading approach for
          measuring total daily energy expenditure in real-world settings. The researchers drew from the International
          Atomic Energy Agency’s global database of doubly labeled water measurements and expanded it by adding three
          additional pastoralist groups: the Aymara in Bolivia, the Tuvan in Siberia, and the Daasanach in northern
          Kenya.
          <p />
        <p class="conclusion-text">The initial dataset contained more than 10,000 adults. The team then filtered out
          anyone with missing sex, reported health conditions, athletic status, implausibly high energy expenditure, or
          ages outside 18 to 60. This produced a final analytic sample of 4,213 adults across 34 population groups.
          These
          groups are specific community samples, not nationally representative estimates. The goal was to compare energy
          expenditure across different subsistence ecologies and economic contexts, not to characterize whole countries.
          <p />
        <p class="conclusion-text">The populations span hunter gatherers, pastoralists, horticulturalists, small
          scale farmers, and industrialized groups. Because nonindustrialized groups do not have formal Human
          Development
          Index scores, the researchers placed them on the HDI spectrum based on their level of market integration.
          Industrialized populations were categorized using standard UN HDI thresholds for low, medium, and high
          development. HDI values were then converted into rank order, so the analysis uses each population’s relative
          position along the development spectrum.
        </p>
        <p class="conclusion-text">Basal energy expenditure came from indirect calorimetry when available or from
          size-based predictive equations when not. Activity energy expenditure and physical activity level were derived
          from the total and basal expenditure values.
        </p>
        <p class="conclusion-text">Because access to the individual level dataset requires a formal research
          application, this analysis uses only the publicly available population means. Working with means makes it
          possible to compare broad patterns across populations, but it introduces important limitations. The underlying
          distributions for each group are not available, so measures such as standard deviations, confidence intervals,
          or within-group variability cannot be calculated. As a result, the analysis can identify population-level
          trends
          across economic and lifestyle contexts, but it cannot capture how much variation exists within each group or
          how
          precise the reported averages are.
        </p>
        <p class="conclusion-text">The visualizations below examine how activity levels vary across economic
          contexts and whether those differences track with body fat percentage or whether another factor explains body
          fat more strongly.

              <p class="card-text">
                This plot compares body fat percentage with Physical Activity Level (PAL), which is total energy
                expenditure divided by basal energy expenditure. PAL gives a size-adjusted measure of daily activity.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                For men, the slope is strongly negative and statistically significant. The p value is 0.01 and R² is
                about 0.21, so PAL explains around 21% of the variation in body fat which is a moderate amount, but not
                large. For women, the slope is not significant. The p value is 0.25 and
                R² is near zero, which means PAL has no detectable linear relationship with body fat in this sample.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                The main takeaway is that higher PAL may predict lower body fat for men, but the effect is
                still only moderate. For women, PAL did not meaningfully predict body fat.

              <p class="card-text">
                This plot compares body fat percentage with the share of ultra-processed foods (UPF) in the diet. Unlike
                the activity plots, the points line up more clearly here. For both men and women, the relationship
                between UPF intake and body fat is statistically significant. The p values are 0.01 for men and 0.005
                for women. The slopes are positive and similar in size, which means higher UPF intake predicts higher
                body fat across sexes.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                For men, PRE is about 0.31. For women, it is about 0.44. These are much higher than what you saw with
                PAL. They are still moderate, not huge, but they indicate that UPF explains a meaningful share of the
                variation in body fat, especially for women. There is still variation. Some groups eat relatively little
                UPF and differ in body fat, and some high-UPF groups sit below the trend line, but the overall slope is
                stronger than what we saw for PAL.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                One additional pattern also starts to emerge. Populations with higher UPF intake tend to have higher HDI
                scores. As countries industrialize, they usually shift toward more processed and packaged foods, and
                that transition aligns with the higher-UPF, higher-body-fat clusters in the plot.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                It’s also worth noting that UPF data were available for only 25 of the 34 populations, so the coverage
                is not complete. Even with that limitation, the relationship appears more consistent than the activity
                based measures. This doesn’t prove that UPF is the cause, but it suggests that dietary composition may
                align more closely with differences in body fat across populations than physical activity does.

        <h2 class="conclusion-heading">Why this matters</h2>
        <p class="conclusion-text">
          Across populations, physical activity did not show a clear pattern that explains large differences in body
          fat. In the subset of groups with dietary data,
          higher intake of ultra processed foods shows a more consistent link with higher body fat. This is
          correlational, not causal proof, but it suggests diet composition may explain population level differences
          better than activity.
        </p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          Public discussions often blame inactivity or willpower. Some of that framing has been shaped by industry
          funded messaging that emphasized exercise over diet <a href="#source-3" class="footnote-link">[3]</a>. If UPFs
          track more closely with body fat than activity does, strategies focused mainly on individual behavior will
          have limited effect. Policies that target food environments, marketing, and UPF availability likely offer a
          stronger lever.</p>

        <h2 class="conclusion-heading">Limitations</h2>
        <p class="conclusion-text">
          Dietary data cover only 25 of the 34 populations, so any dietary pattern is based on a partial sample. The
          analysis relies on population means, which prevents us from seeing how much variation exists within each group
          or how precise the averages are. The data are cross sectional and correlational, meaning they describe
          differences between populations at one point in time and cannot establish causation or track changes over
          time. Energy expenditure measurements come from different studies that used slightly different methods, adding
          measurement noise. These limits narrow what we can infer, but the broad patterns still point toward the need
          for better dietary data, long term studies, and policy approaches that address UPFs directly.
          </ul>
          </br>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          <b>These population patterns suggest that diet may play a far more important role in obesity than many public
            health organizations initially recognized. This growing recognition of diet’s influence also frames how we
            interpret the recent decline in U.S. obesity rates, which further challenges the old notion that physical
            activity was the main driver of rising obesity.</b>

              <p class="card-text">
                Since 2022, U.S. obesity rates have been declining! Gallup's 2025 National Health
                and Well-Being Index reports a drop from 39.9 percent in 2022 to 37.0 percent in 2025, an estimated 7.6
                million fewer adults with obesity <a href="#glp1-source-14" class="footnote-link">[14]</a>.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                The decline aligns with the rapid uptake of GLP-1 drugs, which help people feel full sooner and eat
                less. National spending on these medications
                increased from $13.7 billion in 2018 to $71.7 billion in 2023 <a href="#glp1-source-12"
                  class="footnote-link">[12]</a>. Survey data indicate that roughly 40% of prescriptions are for weight
                management, and adult use has risen from 5.8% in early

        <h3 class="conclusion-heading">UPFs disrupt and GLP-1s restore</h3>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          As shown earlier, the populations with the highest intake of ultra processed foods also tend to have the
          highest body fat percentages. The effectiveness of GLP-1 drugs helps explain why. UPFs interfere with the
          leptin–melanocortin pathway, the brain circuit that regulates hunger, fullness, and metabolism
          <a href="#source-16" class="footnote-link">[16]</a>. GLP-1 drugs
          work by boosting signals in the same pathway
          <a href="#source-17" class="footnote-link">[17]</a>, which makes it clear why disrupting that system with UPFs
          can
          drive weight gain in the first place.
        </p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          UPFs are energy-dense, rapidly absorbable, and engineered to be hyper-palatable. When consumed
          regularly, they drive repeated spikes in glucose, insulin, inflammatory signals, and leptin. Over time, this
          barrage leads the hypothalamus to become progressively less responsive to leptin and insulin, a state called
          leptin and insulin resistance
          <a href="#source-18" class="footnote-link">[18]</a>. In this state, the brain perceives the body as having
          less stored energy than
          it actually does, triggering the same biological response seen in genetic obesity:
          hunger increases, satiety decreases, and metabolic rate slows.
        </p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          Here's why the obesity decline matters, GLP-1 medications act on this same
          energy-regulation circuitry. They stimulate satiety-promoting neurons and dampen hunger-promoting neurons,
          essentially
          overriding the dysfunctional signals that arise from leptin resistance. By counteracting the dysfunction
          of this pathway caused by UPFs, GLP1s help change eating behavior. Specifically, they restore satiety signals
          and in
          doing so reduce the appeal and consumption of hyper-palatable ultra-processed foods
          <a href="#source-19" class="footnote-link">[19]</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          This dual mechanism, restoring satiety and reducing UPF consumption, is likely why we’re seeing the recent
          sustained population level obesity decline in the U.S. It’s not about willpower or exercise. It’s about
          correcting a biological dysfunction caused by UPFs that drives overconsumption.
        </p>

        <h3 class="conclusion-heading">Implications: Where GLP-1s Are Needed Most</h3>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          Understanding that GLP-1 medications work by targeting the same biological pathway disrupted by
          UPF has important policy implications. Since UPF consumption drives obesity through pathway dysfunction, and
          GLP-1s restore that pathway, then ensuring access to these medications in regions with the highest obesity
          rates
          becomes a public health priority.
        </p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          The interactive state-by-state visualization below shows an encouraging pattern: states with higher obesity
          rates tend to have higher GLP-1 prescription counts. This suggests that GLP-1 medications are reaching the
          locations
          where they are needed most. However, it's important to note that this data reflects only prescription
          patterns and does not account for off-label usage or non-prescription access, which may be substantial
          in some regions.
        </p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          Despite this limitation, the alignment between obesity rates and prescription patterns is a positive sign. It
          indicates that clinical need is driving adoption. However, access remains unequal. Monthly out-of-pocket costs
          often
          range from $1,000–$1,300 without insurance
          <a href="#source-20" class="footnote-link">[20]</a>, making these medications unaffordable for many people in
          the regions with
          highest obesity rates (Midwest and Southern) as respective states are mostly also the ones with much lower
          average incomes (feel free to check this out by clicking the 'Size by Income' button in the visualization). As
          a result, the
          true distribution of GLP-1 usage is almost certainly more uneven than the prescription patterns alone suggest.

      <div class="conclusion-content" style="margin-top: 40px;">
        <p class="conclusion-text">
          This underscores a crucial role for government intervention: expanding access to GLP-1 medications in
          high-obesity regions should be a policy priority. If we understand obesity as a biological dysfunction
          caused by environmental factors (namely, UPF-dominated food environments), then treating it requires
          systemic solutions that include making effective medications accessible
          to those who need them most, regardless of income or geography.
        </p>

        <h3 class="conclusion-heading" style="margin-top: 40px;">A Cautionary Note: GLP-1s Are Not a Silver Bullet</h3>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          While this encouraging decline in obesity rates is significant, it does not address the underlying drivers of
          the
          epidemic. GLP-1s can counteract a dysfunctional leptin–melanocortin pathway and restore satiety signals, but
          relying
          solely on medication to manage weight ignores that obesity is only one manifestation of poor dietary
          quality.
        </p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          The goal should not simply be to eat less, it should be to eat better. UPF don't just
          drive weight gain; they are independently associated with cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, metabolic
          dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and many cancers
          <a href="#source-21" class="footnote-link">[21]</a>. A person on GLP-1 medication who continues consuming a
          diet dominated
          by UPFs may lose weight, but they remain exposed to the broader health consequences that obesity, and body
          fat, metrics
          alone don't capture.
        </p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          This underscores the importance of policy action when it comes to our food system. While expanding access to
          GLP-1 medications is a vital public health intervention, it must be paired with efforts to address the root
          cause: the pervasive availability and
          aggressive marketing of ultra-processed foods that makes unhealthy eating the default choice. Policy solutions
          should
          include improving food environments, especially in underserved communities, supporting nutrition education,
          regulating misleading health claims on processed
          foods, and incentivizing the production and accessibility of whole, minimally processed foods.
