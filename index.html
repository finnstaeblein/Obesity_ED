                At its core, obesity occurs when energy intake is consistently higher than energy expenditure. The
                harder question is which side of this balance has changed in modern populations. Public health
                organizations typically point to two possibilities: people may be burning less energy through daily
                activity, or they may be consuming more energy as diets shift <a href="#source-1"
                  class="footnote-link">[1]</a>. To see how this aligns with public perception, consider what Americans
                say is the main reason many people are very overweight.</p>

              <p class="card-text">
                A 2006 Pew survey captured Americans’ beliefs about what was causing obesity. Most respondents pointed
                to personal behavior as the main driver, and they overwhelmingly pointed to one explanation in
                particular: not getting enough exercise. In fact, they rated lack of activity as the most important
                reason people are overweight, ahead of diet, marketing, or genetics <a href="#source-2"
                  class="footnote-link">[2]</a>. While the study was conducted almost a decade ago, it highlights what
                was at least at that time a common hypothesis shared with health organizations, that industrialized
                countries are less physically active than traditional farming or foraging groups, and that activity
                levels may have changed as societies modernized <a href="#source-1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>.

        <h2 class="conclusion-heading">Examining the Activity Hypothesis</h2>
        <p class="conclusion-text">
          Given how common this assumption is, the next step is to look at it with data. Given how common this
          assumption is, the next step is to look at it with actual measurements rather than beliefs. A recent cross
          cultural study published in PNAS did this by using the doubly labeled water method, the leading approach for
          measuring total daily energy expenditure in real-world settings. The researchers drew from the International
          Atomic Energy Agency’s global database of doubly labeled water measurements and expanded it by adding three
          additional pastoralist groups: the Aymara in Bolivia, the Tuvan in Siberia, and the Daasanach in northern
          Kenya.
          <p />
        <p class="conclusion-text">The initial dataset contained more than 10,000 adults. The team then filtered out
          anyone with missing sex, reported health conditions, athletic status, implausibly high energy expenditure, or
          ages outside 18 to 60. This produced a final analytic sample of 4,213 adults across 34 population groups.
          These
          groups are specific community samples, not nationally representative estimates. The goal was to compare energy
          expenditure across different subsistence ecologies and economic contexts, not to characterize whole countries.
          <p />
        <p class="conclusion-text">The populations span hunter gatherers, pastoralists, horticulturalists, small
          scale farmers, and industrialized groups. Because nonindustrialized groups do not have formal Human
          Development
          Index scores, the researchers placed them on the HDI spectrum based on their level of market integration.
          Industrialized populations were categorized using standard UN HDI thresholds for low, medium, and high
          development. HDI values were then converted into rank order, so the analysis uses each population’s relative
          position along the development spectrum.
        </p>
        <p class="conclusion-text">Basal energy expenditure came from indirect calorimetry when available or from
          size-based predictive equations when not. Activity energy expenditure and physical activity level were derived
          from the total and basal expenditure values.
        </p>
        <p class="conclusion-text">Because access to the individual level dataset requires a formal research
          application, this analysis uses only the publicly available population means. Working with means makes it
          possible to compare broad patterns across populations, but it introduces important limitations. The underlying
          distributions for each group are not available, so measures such as standard deviations, confidence intervals,
          or within-group variability cannot be calculated. As a result, the analysis can identify population-level
          trends
          across economic and lifestyle contexts, but it cannot capture how much variation exists within each group or
          how
          precise the reported averages are.
        </p>
        <p class="conclusion-text">The visualizations below examine how activity levels vary across economic
          contexts and whether those differences track with body fat percentage or whether another factor explains body
          fat more strongly.

                The map shows where the 34 sampled communities are located. A few patterns are worth keeping in mind as
                you interpret the results. High-HDI groups are heavily represented, especially in Europe, the US, and
                East Asia. These samples are larger and give more stable averages. In contrast, the subsistence groups
                (hunter gatherers, horticulturalists, and agropastoralist) appear in only a handful of regions and often
                with smaller sample sizes. They are key for comparing different lifestyles, but each point represents
                one community, not an entire country.

                This uneven distribution means the analysis can compare broad differences across economic and lifestyle
                contexts, but high-HDI groups carry more statistical weight and subsistence groups provide only a few
                anchor points.

              <p class="card-text">
                The plot shows that higher-HDI populations generally sit at the lower-rank end and tend to have higher
                body fat percentages, while subsistence groups cluster at the higher-rank end with lower body fat. There
                is still substantial variation within each category, especially among high-HDI populations, but the
                overall slope points upward as development increases.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                What this might suggest is that some factor linked to economic development is associated with higher
                body fat at the population level. This doesn’t tell us what the cause is, and it doesn’t rule out
                multiple explanations, but it sets up the next step: looking at whether activity levels follow a similar
                pattern or whether the stronger pattern appears elsewhere in the data.

              <h4 class="card-title">Body fat vs Physical Activity Level (PAL)</h4>
              <p class="card-text">
                This plot compares body fat percentage with Physical Activity Level (PAL), which is total energy
                expenditure divided by basal energy expenditure. PAL gives a size-adjusted measure of daily activity.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Across populations, the relationship here is weak. Some groups with higher PAL have lower body fat, but
                others do not, and the points are widely scattered for both men and women. High-HDI populations show
                especially broad variation: some are fairly active with moderate body fat, while others have similar PAL
                values but higher body fat.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                What we can take from this is limited but useful. If physical activity were a dominant driver of
                population-level differences in body fat, we would expect a clearer downward trend. Instead, the
                variability suggests that activity alone does not explain why some populations have much higher body fat
                than others. This doesn’t rule out an effect of activity, it just means the pattern is not strong or
                consistent at this scale.

              <p class="card-text">
                This plot compares body fat percentage with the share of ultra processed foods (UPF) in the diet. Unlike
                the activity plots, the points line up more clearly here. Populations with higher UPF intake tend to
                have higher body fat, and this pattern shows up for both men and women. There is still variation, some
                groups eat relatively little UPF and differ in body fat, and some high UPF groups sit below the trend
                line, but the overall slope is stronger than what we saw for PAL or TEE.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                It’s also worth noting that UPF data were available for only 25 of the 34 populations, so the coverage
                is not complete. Even with that limitation, the relationship appears more consistent than the activity
                based measures. This doesn’t prove that UPF is the cause, but it suggests that dietary composition may
                align more closely with differences in body fat across populations than physical activity does.

        <h2 class="conclusion-heading">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="conclusion-text">
          Taken together, the population-level data present a clearer picture of how obesity varies across different
          economic and lifestyle contexts. Once body size is accounted for, physical activity levels show only modest
          variation between populations. That makes it unlikely that changes in daily movement alone explain the large
          differences in obesity rates across societies. By contrast, in the subset of populations for which dietary
          data exist, there is a more consistent link: higher intake of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) appears associated
          with higher body-fat percentage. This does not prove causation, but it suggests dietary composition may matter
          more than activity in shaping obesity differences at population scale.
        </p>

        <h2 class="conclusion-heading">Why this matters</h2>
        <p class="conclusion-text">
          Public understanding of obesity tends to emphasize activity (move more, sit less) and personal responsibility.
          Survey data show many Americans attribute weight problems to lack of exercise or willpower. But this framing
          may reflect not only intuition, it may also reflect the influence of industry: some historical analyses
          suggest that certain food and beverage companies funded studies and public campaigns that highlighted physical
          inactivity as the root cause of obesity <a href="#source-3" class="footnote-link">[3]</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          If dietary factors, especially the prevalence of UPFs, have a stronger link to obesity across populations than
          activity, then strategies focused mainly on individual behavior or exercise may miss a larger lever. Instead
          of placing the burden solely on individuals to "move more," public health efforts might be more effective if
          they address structural and environmental drivers: availability, marketing, formulation, and consumption of
          UPFs.</p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          That's not to say individuals don't matter. Diet and activity both influence health. But orienting policy and
          resources around the stronger population-level signal could lead to larger-scale impact.</p>

        <h2 class="conclusion-heading">Limitations</h2>
        <p class="conclusion-text">
          Several limitations of the dataset and analysis should be noted.
        </p>
        <ul class="conclusion-text">
          <li>The dietary data cover only a portion of the sample (25 of the 34 populations).</li>
          <li>The analysis relies on population means, not individual-level data, so within-population variation and
            uncertainty (such as confidence intervals or standard deviations) cannot be assessed.</li>
          <li>The data are cross-sectional, reflecting differences between populations at one point in time. This
            prevents us from inferring how changes over time influence body fat.</li>
          <li>The associations observed are correlational, and unmeasured factors (such as genetics or other lifestyle
            variables) may contribute to the patterns.</li>
          <li>Energy-expenditure measurements come from different studies and methods, which may introduce measurement
            heterogeneity.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          While these limitations exist, the patterns still point toward a need for better dietary data, long-term
          studies, and policy approaches that address food environments directly. Earlier industry messaging often
          emphasized activity, but moving forward it will be important for governments and communities to take a
          stronger role in challenging that narrative. Framing obesity as a structural issue rather than an individual
          failure can open the door to more funding, better regulation, and broader efforts to reduce UPF exposure and
          support healthier diets.
