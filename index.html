      <p class="card-text">
        Obesity has increased almost everywhere over the past few decades. 
        Estimates from the World Health Organization indicate that global adult obesity 
        has nearly tripled since 1975, reaching about <strong>1 in 8 adults</strong> worldwide by 2022.

        The map above shows the <strong>latest available adult obesity rates by country</strong>. 
        Darker regions indicate a larger share of adults living with obesity, while lighter regions 
        indicate lower levels. The data come from standardized NCD surveys, which makes it 
        possible to compare countries directly.

        A few patterns to notice: high rates appear in places like the 
        <strong>United States</strong>, the <strong>Gulf states</strong>, and several 
        <strong>Pacific Island nations</strong>, while much of <strong>East and Southeast Asia</strong> 
        remains on the lower end. Many countries in <strong>Africa and South Asia</strong> are still 
        relatively low but <strong>rising quickly</strong>.

        Rather than a single global trend, the map suggests very different national trajectories. 
        That raises a question we’ll return to: are these differences driven more by activity, diet, 
        economics, or something else? In the next section, you’ll be able to 
        <strong>click individual countries</strong> to see how their obesity rates have changed over time.

      <p class="card-text">
        What you’ll notice is that almost every country shows an upward trend, but 
        <strong>the timing, slope and Y axis scale are very different</strong>. Some countries 
        began rising early, others much later, and some increased more sharply than others. 
        These differences are the starting point for understanding what might be driving 
        obesity patterns around the world.

      <p class="card-text">
        Try clicking countries with contrasting stories—like the United States, Japan, 
        or the Gulf states. Their trajectories raise important questions about 
        <strong>why some places surged quickly while others remained low for decades</strong>.

      <p class="card-text">
        When you look at the United States on the chart, the obesity curve starts
        climbing early and never really flattens. National survey data show that
        adult obesity has roughly <strong>tripled over the last several decades</strong>, and
        recent CDC estimates put adult obesity at around <strong>40%</strong> of the population.
        <span class="source-inline">

      <p class="card-text">
        In this view, both adults and children in the U.S. show an
        <strong>early, linear rise</strong> compared with many other countries. The levels are not
        only high today; they have been high for a long time. That makes the U.S.
        an example of a country where obesity became common relatively early in the
        global timeline.
      </p>

      <p class="card-text">
        Keep this shape in mind as a reference point when you click through to the
        next countries: is their curve just as steep, delayed, or surprisingly flat?

      <p class="card-text">
        Japan’s trend looks very different. Even as a high-income country with long-standing
        urbanization, its adult obesity levels remain much lower than in most OECD peers.
        Recent analyses find that Japan has one of the <strong>lowest rates of overweight and
        obesity among OECD countries</strong>, and average BMI has changed only gradually over
        several decades.

      <p class="card-text">
        On the chart, that shows up as a <strong>flatter, lower line</strong> for adults and children:
        obesity rises, but much more slowly and from a very low starting point. Compared
        with the U.S., Japan offers a contrast where economic development did not produce
        the same jump in obesity levels.
      </p>

      <p class="card-text">
        This contrast raises a key question for later: if income or development alone
        doesn’t explain the gap between the U.S. and Japan, what else might be different
        in their food environments or daily lives?

      <p class="card-text">
        In many Gulf countries, such as <strong>Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, and Bahrain</strong>,
        the pattern is a later but very rapid rise. Recent estimates place adult obesity
        levels in the <strong>high 30s to low 40s percent</strong> range, putting several of these
        countries among the highest in the world.

      </p>

      <p class="card-text">
        On the chart, that shows up as a <strong>sharp upswing starting later in time</strong>:
        obesity was relatively uncommon several decades ago, then increased quickly alongside
        rapid changes in income, urbanization, and food environments. In some Gulf states,
        women’s obesity rates in particular reach some of the highest levels globally.
      </p>

      <p class="card-text">
        Taken together, these three curves—U.S., Japan, and the Gulf—illustrate that obesity
        can become common early, stay low for a long time, or surge rapidly once conditions
        change. In the next section, you’ll be able to explore these patterns more broadly
        and start asking what might be driving them: <strong>activity, diet, policy, or
        something else entirely?</strong>

        Clicking a country pulls up its <strong>trend lines for women, men, girls, and boys</strong>, 
        when data are available. This makes it easy to compare how quickly obesity has risen, 
        whether children’s trends lag behind adults, and whether patterns differ by sex. 
        In many countries, you’ll see that childhood obesity is now climbing into ranges 
        that used to be seen mainly in adults.

                At its core, obesity occurs when energy intake is consistently higher than energy expenditure. The
                harder question is which side of this balance has changed in modern populations. Public health
                organizations typically point to two possibilities: people may be burning less energy through daily
                activity, or they may be consuming more energy as diets shift <a href="#source-1"
                  class="footnote-link">[1]</a>. To see how this aligns with public perception, consider what Americans
                say is the main reason many people are very overweight.</p>

                A 2006 Pew survey captured Americans’ beliefs about what was causing obesity. Most respondents pointed
                to personal behavior as the main driver, and they overwhelmingly pointed to one explanation in
                particular: not getting enough exercise. In fact, they rated lack of activity as the most important
                reason people are overweight, ahead of diet, marketing, or genetics <a href="#source-2"
                  class="footnote-link">[2]</a>. While the study was conducted almost a decade ago, it highlights what
                was at least at that time a common hypothesis shared with health organizations, that industrialized

                levels may have changed as societies modernized <a href="#source-1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>.

        <h2 class="conclusion-heading">Examining the Activity Hypothesis</h2>
        <p class="conclusion-text">
          Given how common this assumption is, the next step is to look at it with data. Given how common this
          assumption is, the next step is to look at it with actual measurements rather than beliefs. A recent cross
          cultural study published in PNAS did this by using the doubly labeled water method, the leading approach for
          measuring total daily energy expenditure in real-world settings. The researchers drew from the International
          Atomic Energy Agency’s global database of doubly labeled water measurements and expanded it by adding three
          additional pastoralist groups: the Aymara in Bolivia, the Tuvan in Siberia, and the Daasanach in northern
          Kenya.
          <p />
        <p class="conclusion-text">The initial dataset contained more than 10,000 adults. The team then filtered out
          anyone with missing sex, reported health conditions, athletic status, implausibly high energy expenditure, or
          ages outside 18 to 60. This produced a final analytic sample of 4,213 adults across 34 population groups.
          These
          groups are specific community samples, not nationally representative estimates. The goal was to compare energy
          expenditure across different subsistence ecologies and economic contexts, not to characterize whole countries.
          <p />
        <p class="conclusion-text">The populations span hunter gatherers, pastoralists, horticulturalists, small
          scale farmers, and industrialized groups. Because nonindustrialized groups do not have formal Human
          Development
          Index scores, the researchers placed them on the HDI spectrum based on their level of market integration.
          Industrialized populations were categorized using standard UN HDI thresholds for low, medium, and high
          development. HDI values were then converted into rank order, so the analysis uses each population’s relative
          position along the development spectrum.
        </p>
        <p class="conclusion-text">Basal energy expenditure came from indirect calorimetry when available or from
          size-based predictive equations when not. Activity energy expenditure and physical activity level were derived
          from the total and basal expenditure values.
        </p>
        <p class="conclusion-text">Because access to the individual level dataset requires a formal research
          application, this analysis uses only the publicly available population means. Working with means makes it
          possible to compare broad patterns across populations, but it introduces important limitations. The underlying
          distributions for each group are not available, so measures such as standard deviations, confidence intervals,
          or within-group variability cannot be calculated. As a result, the analysis can identify population-level
          trends
          across economic and lifestyle contexts, but it cannot capture how much variation exists within each group or
          how
          precise the reported averages are.
        </p>
        <p class="conclusion-text">The visualizations below examine how activity levels vary across economic
          contexts and whether those differences track with body fat percentage or whether another factor explains body
          fat more strongly.

                The map shows where the 34 sampled communities are located. A few patterns are worth keeping in mind as
                you interpret the results. High-HDI groups are heavily represented, especially in Europe, the US, and
                East Asia. These samples are larger and give more stable averages. In contrast, the subsistence groups
                (hunter gatherers, horticulturalists, and agropastoralist) appear in only a handful of regions and often
                with smaller sample sizes. They are key for comparing different lifestyles, but each point represents
                one community, not an entire country.

                This uneven distribution means the analysis can compare broad differences across economic and lifestyle
                contexts, but high-HDI groups carry more statistical weight and subsistence groups provide only a few
                anchor points.

              <p class="card-text">
                The plot shows that higher-HDI populations generally sit at the lower-rank end and tend to have higher
                body fat percentages, while subsistence groups cluster at the higher-rank end with lower body fat. There
                is still substantial variation within each category, especially among high-HDI populations, but the
                overall slope points upward as development increases.

                What this might suggest is that some factor linked to economic development is associated with higher
                body fat at the population level. This doesn’t tell us what the cause is, and it doesn’t rule out
                multiple explanations, but it sets up the next step: looking at whether activity levels follow a similar
                pattern or whether the stronger pattern appears elsewhere in the data.

              <p class="card-text">
                This plot compares body fat percentage with Physical Activity Level (PAL), which is total energy
                expenditure divided by basal energy expenditure. PAL gives a size-adjusted measure of daily activity.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Across populations, the relationship here is weak. Some groups with higher PAL have lower body fat, but
                others do not, and the points are widely scattered for both men and women. High-HDI populations show
                especially broad variation: some are fairly active with moderate body fat, while others have similar PAL
                values but higher body fat.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                What we can take from this is limited but useful. If physical activity were a dominant driver of
                population-level differences in body fat, we would expect a clearer downward trend. Instead, the
                variability suggests that activity alone does not explain why some populations have much higher body fat
                than others. This doesn’t rule out an effect of activity, it just means the pattern is not strong or
                consistent at this scale.

                This plot compares body fat percentage with the share of ultra processed foods (UPF) in the diet. Unlike
                the activity plots, the points line up more clearly here. Populations with higher UPF intake tend to
                have higher body fat, and this pattern shows up for both men and women. There is still variation, some
                groups eat relatively little UPF and differ in body fat, and some high UPF groups sit below the trend
                line, but the overall slope is stronger than what we saw for PAL or TEE.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                It’s also worth noting that UPF data were available for only 25 of the 34 populations, so the coverage
                is not complete. Even with that limitation, the relationship appears more consistent than the activity
                based measures. This doesn’t prove that UPF is the cause, but it suggests that dietary composition may
                align more closely with differences in body fat across populations than physical activity does.

        <h2 class="conclusion-heading">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="conclusion-text">
          Taken together, the population-level data present a clearer picture of how obesity varies across different
          economic and lifestyle contexts. Once body size is accounted for, physical activity levels show only modest
          variation between populations. That makes it unlikely that changes in daily movement alone explain the large
          differences in obesity rates across societies. By contrast, in the subset of populations for which dietary
          data exist, there is a more consistent link: higher intake of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) appears associated
          with higher body-fat percentage. This does not prove causation, but it suggests dietary composition may matter
          more than activity in shaping obesity differences at population scale.
        </p>

        <h2 class="conclusion-heading">Why this matters</h2>
        <p class="conclusion-text">
          Public understanding of obesity tends to emphasize activity (move more, sit less) and personal responsibility.
          Survey data show many Americans attribute weight problems to lack of exercise or willpower. But this framing
          may reflect not only intuition, it may also reflect the influence of industry: some historical analyses
          suggest that certain food and beverage companies funded studies and public campaigns that highlighted physical
          inactivity as the root cause of obesity <a href="#source-3" class="footnote-link">[3]</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          If dietary factors, especially the prevalence of UPFs, have a stronger link to obesity across populations than
          activity, then strategies focused mainly on individual behavior or exercise may miss a larger lever. Instead
          of placing the burden solely on individuals to "move more," public health efforts might be more effective if
          they address structural and environmental drivers: availability, marketing, formulation, and consumption of
          UPFs.</p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          That's not to say individuals don't matter. Diet and activity both influence health. But orienting policy and
          resources around the stronger population-level signal could lead to larger-scale impact.</p>

        <h2 class="conclusion-heading">Limitations</h2>
        <p class="conclusion-text">
          Several limitations of the dataset and analysis should be noted.
        </p>
        <ul class="conclusion-text">
          <li>The dietary data cover only a portion of the sample (25 of the 34 populations).</li>
          <li>The analysis relies on population means, not individual-level data, so within-population variation and
            uncertainty (such as confidence intervals or standard deviations) cannot be assessed.</li>
          <li>The data are cross-sectional, reflecting differences between populations at one point in time. This
            prevents us from inferring how changes over time influence body fat.</li>
          <li>The associations observed are correlational, and unmeasured factors (such as genetics or other lifestyle
            variables) may contribute to the patterns.</li>
          <li>Energy-expenditure measurements come from different studies and methods, which may introduce measurement
            heterogeneity.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          While these limitations exist, the patterns still point toward a need for better dietary data, long-term
          studies, and policy approaches that address food environments directly. Earlier industry messaging often
          emphasized activity, but moving forward it will be important for governments and communities to take a
          stronger role in challenging that narrative. Framing obesity as a structural issue rather than an individual
          failure can open the door to more funding, better regulation, and broader efforts to reduce UPF exposure and
          support healthier diets.

              <h3 class="card-title">The genetic paradox</h3>

              <p class="card-text">
                The fact that obesity has quadrupled over the last five decades makes one point unmistakably clear:
                the epidemic cannot be explained by genetics alone. Genetic frequencies (the makeup of our DNA) change
                over thousands or even millions of years, not within a single human lifetime. While there is a genetic
                component to individual obesity, focusing on this might seem entirely misguided given that the cause of
                the obesity pandemic clearly lies elsewhere.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                This perspective is flawed, however, since understanding why individuals are more susceptible to obesity
                might help us understand how to decrease susceptibility of everyone. Historically, scientists viewed
                obesity as two distinct conditions: 1) severe, early-onset obesity which is caused by detrimental
                alterations in single genes and 2) 'common' obesity which results from small alterations in many genes.
                What scientists came to understand though, is that both point towards the same underlying biological
                mechanism: the leptin–melanocortin pathway, a hormonal-neuronal circuit in the hypothalamus that tells
                your brain how much energy the body has, whether to feel hungry or full, and whether to burn calories
                or conserve them.

              <h3 class="card-title">The leptin–melanocortin pathway</h3>

              <p class="card-text">
                The preceding image visualizes this neuronal circuitry. It illustrates how hormonal signals such as
                leptin (released from fat tissue) and insulin (released from the pancreas) bind to specific neurons
                in the hypothalamus. These signals are meant to initiate a coordinated cascade: activating POMC neurons
                that promote satiety, while simultaneously inhibiting AgRP neurons that drive hunger. When this cascade
                works as intended, the brain accurately gauges the body's energy state and maintains a balanced regulation
                of appetite, fullness, and energy expenditure.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                But when perturbed – whether by a rare, high-impact mutation or the cumulative effect of many small
                genetic variants – this energy-sensing system becomes distorted. The brain begins to misread the body
                as under-fed, even when it is not. As a result, individuals receive skewed biological signals that
                increase hunger, blunt satiety, and reduce metabolic rate.
              </p>

              <h4 class="card-title">UPFs disrupt the same pathway</h4>

              <p class="card-text">
                Importantly, the same leptin–melanocortin pathway is disrupted by diets dominated by ultra-processed foods.
                UPFs act as a physiological stressor on the pathway, pushing it into a state of dysfunction that mimics,
                in a weaker form, the signaling failures seen in genetic obesity.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                UPFs are energy-dense, rapidly absorbable, and engineered to be hyper-palatable. When consumed regularly,
                they drive repeated spikes in glucose, insulin, inflammatory signals, and leptin. Over time, this barrage
                leads the hypothalamus to become progressively less responsive to leptin. In this state of leptin resistance,
                the brain perceives the body as having less stored energy than it actually does. The result is a maladaptive
                shift in the same brain circuits affected by genetic variants: hunger increases, satiety decreases, and
                metabolic rate slows.

              <h3 class="card-title">Why UPFs affect both sides of the energy equation</h3>

              <p class="card-text">
                Critically, eating UPFs does not only lead to impaired satiety regulation and thus likely to a higher
                caloric intake, but also disrupt the other side of the energy balance equation. Chronic consumption
                lowers your metabolic rate by:
              </p>

              <ul class="card-text">
                <li>Shifting your brain towards energy conversion mode (as the hypothalamus assumes a need to conserve
                    energy because of its resistance to leptin)</li>
                <li>Causing chronic, low-grade inflammation in the hypothalamus, which suppresses basal metabolic rate</li>
                <li>Requiring minimal energy to digest (e.g. 100g of almonds need ~30kcal to digest, whereas 100g of
                    UPFs need ~5kcal)</li>
                <li>Lowering non-exercise caloric burn as the hypothalamus controls spontaneous movement (such as fidgeting),
                    which you're less likely to engage in when the leptin–melanocortin pathway is impaired</li>
              </ul>

              <p class="card-text">
                <strong>The key takeaway here is that the same satiety-regulating neuronal pathway that rare gene
                mutations disrupt in a few individuals is disrupted by UPFs in entire populations.</strong>

              <h3 class="card-title">GLP-1s target the same pathway</h3>

              <p class="card-text">
                This also explains why GLP-1s are so effective. Although GLP-1 receptor agonists (such as semaglutide
                and tirzepatide) do not directly repair the leptin–melanocortin pathway, they effectively bypass its
                dysfunction by activating downstream circuits that compensate for its impaired signaling.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                GLP-1 receptors are expressed on several of the same hypothalamic neurons involved in the leptin–melanocortin
                system, including POMC neurons—the very neurons that normally promote satiety when leptin binds to them.
                In individuals with genetic susceptibility or leptin resistance, these neurons receive a weakened or
                distorted signal from leptin. GLP-1 agonists step in by stimulating these satiety-promoting neurons through
                a different hormonal channel, restoring the fullness signal that the brain would otherwise be missing.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                In addition, GLP-1 agonists reduce activity in AgRP/NPY "hunger neurons," the counterparts that normally
                elevate appetite when the brain thinks energy stores are low. By dampening these neurons and simultaneously
                enhancing POMC activity, GLP-1 drugs re-establish a functional imbalance in favor of satiety—essentially
                overriding the biased energy-deficit signals coming from a disrupted leptin–melanocortin system.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                This dual action explains why GLP-1 medications so effectively reduce appetite, increase fullness, and
                shift energy expenditure in a direction that supports weight loss, even in individuals whose central
                regulatory circuits are environmentally (or in rare cases genetically) impaired.
