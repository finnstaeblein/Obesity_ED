                Obesity has increased almost everywhere over the past few decades.
                Estimates from the World Health Organization indicate that global adult obesity
                has nearly tripled since 1975, reaching about 1 in 8 adults
                worldwide by 2022. <a href="#source-4" class="footnote-link">[4]</a>

                While the timing and speed of rising obesity differ across countries, obesity is
                becoming more prevelant globally. This raises two questions: 1) why is it increasing, and 2) what explains the
                differences between countries?

                At its core, obesity occurs when energy intake is consistently higher than energy expenditure.
                The harder question is which side of that balance has shifted in the last few decades. Public health
                organizations typically point to two possibilities: people may be burning less energy through daily
                activity, or they may be consuming more energy as diets shift.

                A 2006 Pew survey captured Americans’ beliefs about what was causing obesity. Most respondents pointed
                to personal behavior as the main driver, and they overwhelmingly pointed to one explanation in
                particular: not getting enough exercise. Specifically, they rated lack of activity as the most important
                reason people are overweight, ahead of diet, marketing, or genetics.

        <h2 class="conclusion-heading">Examining the Activity Hypothesis</h2>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          A cross-cultural study published in PNAS directly tested the assumption that rising obesity is driven by declines in
          physical activity. The researchers measured total daily energy expenditure using the doubly labeled water
          method,  which captures how much energy people actually burn in their everyday lives. The data were drawn from the International 
          Atomic Energy Agency’s global database and supplemented with three additional populations: the Aymara in Bolivia,
          the Tuvan in Siberia, and the Daasanach in northern Kenya.
          <a href="#source-1" class="footnote-link">[1]</a>
        </p>
        <p class="conclusion-text">
          TThe final study sample included 4,213 adults across 34 population groups. While the original researchers had 
          access to individual-level measurements, access to those data requires a formal application. This analysis 
          therefore relies on the published population means. Importantly, each population represents a community-level 
          sample rather than a national estimate.
        </p>
        <p class="conclusion-text">
          We included hunter gatherers, pastoralists, horticulturalists, small scale farmers, and industrialized groups
          because they differ in lifestyle, and market integration. These differences allow
          meaningful comparisons across variables that may predict obesity levels. To measure obesity, we used body fat 
          percentage rather than body mass index to avoid misclassifying individuals with higher muscle mass.
        </p>
        <!-- Nonindustrialized groups were placed on the Human Development Index spectrum using their level of market
          integration. Industrialized groups used standard UN HDI thresholds. All HDI values were converted into ranks
          to place the 34 groups on a single development continuum. -->

        <!-- <p class="conclusion-text" style="color: #1f2937;">
          Given how common this assumption is, the next step is to look at it with data. Given how common this
          assumption is, the next step is to look at it with actual measurements rather than beliefs. A recent cross
          cultural study published in PNAS did this by using the doubly labeled water method, the leading approach for
          measuring total daily energy expenditure in real-world settings. The researchers drew from the International
          Atomic Energy Agency’s global database of doubly labeled water measurements and expanded it by adding three
          additional pastoralist groups: the Aymara in Bolivia, the Tuvan in Siberia, and the Daasanach in northern
          Kenya.
          <p />
        <p class="conclusion-text" style="color: #1f2937;">The initial dataset contained more than 10,000 adults. The team then filtered out
          anyone with missing sex, reported health conditions, athletic status, implausibly high energy expenditure, or
          ages outside 18 to 60. This produced a final analytic sample of 4,213 adults across 34 population groups.
          These
          groups are specific community samples, not nationally representative estimates. The goal was to compare energy
          expenditure across different subsistence ecologies and economic contexts, not to characterize whole countries.
          <p />
        <p class="conclusion-text" style="color: #1f2937;">The populations span hunter gatherers, pastoralists, horticulturalists, small
          scale farmers, and industrialized groups. Because nonindustrialized groups do not have formal Human
          Development
          Index scores, the researchers placed them on the HDI spectrum based on their level of market integration.
          Industrialized populations were categorized using standard UN HDI thresholds for low, medium, and high
          development. HDI values were then converted into rank order, so the analysis uses each population’s relative
          position along the development spectrum.
        </p>
        <p class="conclusion-text" style="color: #1f2937;">Basal energy expenditure came from indirect calorimetry when available or from
          size-based predictive equations when not. Activity energy expenditure and physical activity level were derived
          from the total and basal expenditure values.
        </p>
        <p class="conclusion-text" style="color: #1f2937;">Because access to the individual level dataset requires a formal research
          application, this analysis uses only the publicly available population means. Working with means makes it
          possible to compare broad patterns across populations, but it introduces important limitations. The underlying
          distributions for each group are not available, so measures such as standard deviations, confidence intervals,
          or within-group variability cannot be calculated. As a result, the analysis can identify population-level
          trends
          across economic and lifestyle contexts, but it cannot capture how much variation exists within each group or
          how
          precise the reported averages are.
        </p>
        <p class="conclusion-text" style="color: #1f2937;">The visualizations below examine how activity levels vary across economic
          contexts and whether those differences track with body fat percentage or whether another factor explains body
          fat more strongly.

              <p class="card-text">
                This plot compares body fat percentage with Physical Activity Level (PAL), which is total energy
                expenditure divided by basal energy expenditure. PAL gives a size-adjusted measure of daily activity.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                For men, the slope is strongly negative and statistically significant. The p value is 0.01 and R² is
                about 0.21, so PAL explains around 21% of the variation in body fat which is a moderate amount. 
                For women, the slope is not significant. The p value is 0.25 and
                R² is near zero, which means PAL has no detectable linear relationship with body fat in this sample.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                The main takeaway is that higher PAL - to a moderate degree - helps predict lower body fat for men. 
                For women, PAL did not meaningfully predict body fat.

              <p class="card-text">
                This plot compares body fat percentage with the share of ultra-processed foods (UPF) in the diet. Unlike
                the activity plots, the points line up more clearly here. For both men and women, the relationship
                between UPF intake and body fat is statistically significant. The p values are 0.01 for men and 0.005
                for women. The slopes are positive and similar in size, which means higher UPF intake predicts higher
                body fat across sexes.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                For men, PRE is about 0.31. For women, it is about 0.44. These are much higher than the correlation you saw between
                PAL and obesity. They are still moderate, but indicate that amount of UPF consumption explains a meaningful share of the
                variation in body fat, especially for women. Of course, there is still variation: some groups eat relatively little
                UPF and have a higher body fat percentage, whereas some high-UPF groups sit below the trend line.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                One additional pattern starts to emerge: populations with higher UPF intake tend to have higher HDI
                (Human Development Index) scores — a composite measure of a country’s income, education, and life expectancy.
                The reason for this is that as countries industrialize, they usually shift toward more processed and packaged foods.
                You can examine this by looking at the U.S. and South Africa in the plot above — both lie in the higher-UPF,
                higher-body-fat clusters.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                It’s also worth noting that UPF data were available for only 25 of the 34 populations, so the coverage
                isn't complete. Even with that limitation, the relationship between UPFs and obesity appears more consistent 
                than the that between obesity and physical activity. This doesn’t prove that UPF causes obesity, but suggests that dietary composition may
                align more closely with differences in body fat across populations than physical activity does.

                The analysis relies on population means, which prevents us from seeing how much variation exists within
                each group or how precise the averages are. The data are cross sectional and correlational, meaning they
                describe differences between populations at one point in time and cannot establish causation or track
                changes over time. Energy expenditure measurements come from different studies that used slightly different
                methods, adding measurement noise. These limits narrow what we can infer, but the broad patterns still
                point toward the need for better dietary data, long term studies, and policy approaches that address UPFs

              <h3 class="card-title">The Genetic Myth</h3>

              <p class="card-text">
                In the survey above, we have seen that many Americans believe that genetics are a key factor in the obesity epidemic.
                However, looking at the timespan of this epidemic (namely global obesity tripling over the last five decades)
                makes one point unmistakably clear: this epidemic cannot be explained by genetics.
                The reason for this is that genetic frequencies (the makeup of our DNA) change
                over thousands or even millions of years, not within a single human lifetime, meaning that our DNA today is not
                different in any significant way than it was 50 years ago. While there is a genetic
                component to individual obesity, focusing on this might seem entirely misguided given that the cause of
                the obesity pandemic clearly lies elsewhere.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                This perspective is flawed, however, since understanding the mechanism that makes some individuals are more susceptible to obesity
                will help us understand mechanisms underlying the meteoric rise in the general population. Historically, scientists viewed
                obesity as two distinct conditions: 1) severe, early-onset obesity which is caused by detrimental
                alterations in single genes; and 2) 'common' obesity which results from small alterations in many genes.
                More recently scientists came to understand that both point towards the same underlying biological
                mechanism: the leptin–melanocortin pathway, a hormonal-neuronal circuit in the hypothalamus that tells
                your brain how much energy your body has, whether to feel hungry or full, and whether to burn calories
                or conserve them (i.e. it regulates your metabolism).

                The preceding image visualizes this neuronal circuitry. It illustrates how hormonal signals such as
                leptin (released from fat tissue) and insulin (released from the pancreas) enter the brain and
                bind to specific neurons in the hypothalamus: POMC neurons and AgRP neurons.
                In POMC cells, leptin and insulin stimulate the production of α-MSH,
                a peptide that activates MC4R receptors on downstream neurons to promote satiety and increase energy
                expenditure.
                In AgRP neurons, by contrast, the same hormonal signals suppress firing and reduce the
                release of AgRP and NPY, two potent drivers of hunger and metabolic conservation.
                When this cascade
                works as intended, the brain accurately gauges the body's energy state and maintains a balanced regulation
                of appetite, fullness, and energy expenditure.

                But when perturbed – whether by a rare, high-impact mutation or the cumulative effect of many small
                genetic variants – this energy-sensing system becomes distorted, leading, for instance, to less
                responsive POMC and AgRP neurons.
                As a result, the hypothalamus begins to misinterpret normal or even elevated leptin levels as if
                they were low, effectively reading the body as under-fed when it is not. Affected individuals then receive
                skewed biological signals that increase hunger, blunt satiety, and reduce metabolic rate. In other words, they suffer from
                a biological imbalance towards higher weight.

                UPFs are energy-dense, rapidly absorbable, and engineered to be hyper-palatable. When consumed regularly,
                they drive repeated spikes in glucose, insulin, inflammatory signals, and leptin. Over time, this barrage
                leads the hypothalamus to become progressively less responsive to leptin and insulin.
                <a href="#source-29" class="footnote-link">[25]</a> In this state of leptin and insulin resistance,
                the brain perceives the body as having less stored energy than it actually does. The result is the
                same as in genetically linked obesity: hunger increases, satiety decreases, and metabolic rate slows.

                Critically, eating UPFs does not only lead to impaired satiety regulation and thus likely to a higher
                caloric intake, but also disrupt the other side of the energy balance equation. Chronic consumption
                lowers your metabolic rate by:
              </p>

              <ul class="card-text">
                <li>Shifting your brain towards energy conversion mode (as the hypothalamus assumes a need to conserve
                    energy because of its resistance to leptin)</li>
                <li>Causing chronic, low-grade inflammation in the hypothalamus, which suppresses basal metabolic rate.
                    <a href="#source-15" class="footnote-link">[13]</a></li>
                <li>Requiring minimal energy to digest (e.g. 100g of almonds need ~30kcal to digest, whereas 100g of
                    UPFs need ~5kcal).
                    <a href="#source-30" class="footnote-link">[26]</a></li>
                <li>Lowering non-exercise caloric burn as the hypothalamus controls spontaneous movement (such as fidgeting),
                    which you're less likely to engage in when the leptin–melanocortin pathway is impaired.

                <strong>The key takeaway here is that the same satiety-regulating neuronal pathway that rare gene

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          Above we have seen that ultra-processed foods disrupt the leptin-melanocortin pathway, and in doing so
          disable the body's ability to accurately regulate hunger, while also lowering your metabolic rate.
          What this means is that when regularly consuming UPFs overeating isn't primarily about willpower—it 
          is the natural course of action as you simply stop receiving signals that you are full.
        </p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          On the flipside, it is very unlikely to become obese when only eating non-processed foods because
          your body is able to accurately regulate hunger — an ability it has perfected over hundreds
          of thousands of years of evolution. After reaching your caloric needs, you simply don't want 
          o eat more fruits, vegetables, chicken, or bulgur.
        </p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          While it's true that fast food chains are the epitome of ultra-processing, many common foods are also substantially processed — including pasta,
          cheese, almost all types of bread (certainly in the US), sausage, and many protein bars.
          Not all processed food is necessarily 'bad' for you and vice versa, there are unprocessed foods you shouldn't have too much of.
          However, when it comes to satiety regulation, most (ultra-)processed foods impair this mechanism.
        </p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          The satiety regulating mechanism is also why optimal diets for weight loss are both rich in unprocessed fruits and vegetables
          (meaning high in fiber) as well as high in (unprocessed) protein: fiber and protein are extremely good at regulating hunger.

              <p class="card-text">
                Since 2022, U.S. obesity rates have been declining! Gallup's 2025 National Health
                and Well-Being Index reports a drop from 39.9 percent in 2022 to 37.0 percent in 2025, an estimated 7.6
                million fewer adults with obesity.
                <a href="#glp1-source-14" class="footnote-link">[18]</a>
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                The decline aligns with the rapid uptake of GLP-1 drugs, which help people feel full sooner and eat
                less. National spending on these medications
                increased from $13.7 billion in 2018 to $71.7 billion in 2023.
                  <a href="#glp1-source-12" class="footnote-link">[17]</a> Survey data indicate that roughly 40% of prescriptions are for weight
                management, and adult use has risen from 5.8% in early
                2024 to 12.4% in 2025.

              <p class="card-text">
                The steepest reductions in obesity are occurring in the very age groups with the highest GLP-1 usage
                (ages 40–64), suggesting these medications may be contributing to the first sustained population-level
                decline in U.S. obesity rates.

              <div class="step-indicator">2/2</div>
              <h3 class="card-title">How GLP-1s Target the Same Pathway</h3>

              <p class="card-text">
                Importantly, the leptin–melanocortin pathway we explored above enables us to understand why GLP-1s are so effective.
                Although GLP-1 receptor agonists (such as semaglutide, the active drug molecule found in Ozempic and Wegovy; as well as
                tirzepatide, found in Rybelsus and Zepbound) do not directly repair the leptin–melanocortin pathway, they effectively bypass its
                dysfunction by activating downstream circuits that compensate for its impaired signaling.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                GLP-1 receptors are expressed on several of the same hypothalamic neurons involved in the leptin–melanocortin
                system, including POMC neurons—the neurons that normally promote satiety when leptin binds to them.
                <a href="#source-22" class="footnote-link">[21]</a> <a href="#source-17" class="footnote-link">[15]</a>
                In individuals with genetic susceptibility or leptin resistance, these neurons receive a weakened signal from leptin.
                GLP-1 agonists step in by stimulating these satiety-promoting neurons through
                a different hormonal channel, restoring the fullness signal the brain would otherwise be missing.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                In addition, GLP-1 agonists reduce activity in AgRP/NPY "hunger neurons," the counterparts that normally
                elevate appetite when the brain thinks energy stores are low.
                <a href="#source-17" class="footnote-link">[15]</a> By dampening these neurons and simultaneously
                enhancing POMC activity, GLP-1 drugs re-establish a functional imbalance in favor of satiety — essentially
                overriding the biased signals coming from a disrupted leptin–melanocortin system.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                This dual action explains why GLP-1 medications so effectively reduce appetite, increase fullness, and
                shift energy expenditure in a direction that supports weight loss, even in individuals whose central
                regulatory circuits are environmentally (or in rare cases genetically) impaired.

        <h3 class="conclusion-heading">UPFs disrupt and GLP-1s restore</h3>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          The TL;DR is that GLP1s bypass the dysfunction of the
          leptin–melanocortin pathway, which is caused by regular ultra-processed food consumption
          and affects - to different degrees - the majority of the population in most industrialized conutries.
          <a href="#source-16" class="footnote-link">[14]</a> <a href="#source-17" class="footnote-link">[15]</a>
         By stimulating satiety-promoting neurons and dampening hunger-promoting neurons,
          GLP1s essentially
          override the dysfunctional signals that arise from leptin resistance and in doing so, help change eating behavior.

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          This is likely why we're seeing the first
          slight population level obesity decline in U.S history. <strong> It's not about willpower or exercise. It's about

        <p class="conclusion-text" style="color: #1f2937;">
          Understanding that GLP-1 medications work by targeting the same biological pathway disrupted by
          UPF has important policy implications. Since UPF consumption drives obesity through pathway dysfunction, and
          GLP-1s restore that pathway, then ensuring access to these medications in regions with the highest obesity
          rates
          becomes a public health priority.

        <h3 class="conclusion-heading" style="margin-top: 40px;">GLP-1s Are Not a Silver Bullet</h3>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          While this decline in obesity rates is awesome, it does not address the underlying driver of
          the
          epidemic. GLP-1s can counteract a dysfunctional leptin–melanocortin pathway and restore satiety signals, but
          relying
          solely on medication to manage weight ignores that obesity is only one manifestation of poor dietary
          quality.
        </p>

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          The goal should not simply be to eat less, it should be to eat better. UPF don't just
          drive weight gain; they are independently associated with cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, metabolic
          dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and many cancers.
          <a href="#source-21" class="footnote-link">[16]</a> A person on GLP-1 medication who continues consuming a
          diet dominated
          by UPFs may lose weight (which is awesome, bot for their pysical and mental health),
          but they remain exposed to the broader health consequences that obesity, and body
          fat, metrics alone don't capture.

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          This emphasis the importance of policy action when it comes to our food system. Specifically,

        <p class="conclusion-text">
          Across this report, we challenged the widespread assumption that obesity is primarily caused by a lack of
          physical activity.
          Instead, we saw that ultra processed food consumption more accurately predict differences in body fat,
          because it disrupts the brain
          circuts that regulate satiefty. Consequently, the recent U.S. decline in obesity rates (the first sustained one in its history)
          can likely be attributed to the spread of GLP-1 drugs that target the downstream brain circuits UPFs disrupt.
        </p>
        <p class="conclusion-text">
          Public discussions often blame inactivity or willpower. Some of that framing has been shaped by industry
          funded messaging that emphasized exercise over diet.
          <a href="#source-3" class="footnote-link">[3]</a>
          Because of the biological changes in satieety regulation from consuming UPFs, strategies focused mainly on individual behavior will
          have limited effect. Policies that target food environments, marketing, and UPF availability offer a
          stronger lever.
